## A simple user login. 

**User-Login**:

**A User can make an account by signing up with there email, and adding a password. Then they can sign in, and change there profile name.**:

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Make it so when you login to the app you can actaully do somthing with the software besides just login.
* [ ] Make the Login more clean and not just basic css.
* [ ] Simplify my code a bit. Right now its quite a jumble and not organized at all.
